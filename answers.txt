Merge vs Rebase

A merge combines changes from two or more branches into a single branch by creating a new merge commit. 
This new commit records the fact that the changes from one branch have been added to another branch. 

A rebase, on the other hand, reapplies a branch's changes on top of another branch. This results in a linear history.
It is as if the changes made in the target branch at that time were made in the orig source .
